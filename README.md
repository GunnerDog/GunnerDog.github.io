## Bio
  I am going to EWU for collage to become a graphic designer. I hope to someday use this to create my own website for a coffee shop that I want to open in the future and sell coffee and art. I love art and watching videos of people making art I find it very calming. I love God and have been a christian for my entire life and always and still do go to church with my family. We went to Spokane Christian Center until I was 18 and then we decided to move to Summit in Cheney beacause my brothers and their girlfriends/ wifes, started going there. I like going camping and going to the lake to go boating and swimming I would deffinetly say that the forest, camp sites, and the lake/ river and streams are my get away from work and to really enjoy life with my family.
